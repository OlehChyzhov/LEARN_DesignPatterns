# Design Patterns Study Notes ðŸ¤“

This repository contains C# implementations of design patterns based on a course I've taken. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

### ðŸ“‚ File Structure by Course Section

In this Console application, each design pattern has its own dedicated folder.

#### ðŸ”· SOLID Principles Structure

Each principle is implemented in a separate file and structured as follows:

- `#Default Objects` â€” Objects required for demonstration.
- `#Problem` â€” Step-by-step explanation of the problem or violation.
- `#*_ViolationExample` *(optional)* â€” Example showing how the principle is violated.
- `#Solution` â€” Step-by-step explanation of the correct implementation.
- `#*_Example` â€” A class with a `Run()` method that can be invoked from `Main`.

### ðŸ§  Purpose

This repository serves as a **quick-reference guide**.  
It helps reinforce concepts and acts as a cheat sheet when working with design patterns in the future.
